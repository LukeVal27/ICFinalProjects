    <h1>Final project of Integrated circuit design (CENG465, undergraduate class), Spring 2025: design, simulate, and verify flip flops at layout level from circuits in IEEE papers</h1>

    <h3></h3>
    <p> IC design in this project was performed using the following tools:<br>
Cadence Virtuoso for schematic and layout creation, Synopsys Hspice for simulation, Siemens Calibre for layout verification.<br></p>
<p>The process involved designing a flip-flop circuit based on an IEEE paper. The design flow included the following:<br>
Schematic capture in Virtuoso,  followed by layout creation.<br>
Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification were conducted using Calibre to ensure layout correctness and connectivity matching the schematic.<br>
Parasitic capacitances were extracted using Calibre's parasitic extraction (PEX) feature integrated within Virtuoso.<br>
Post-layout simulations were carried out in Hspice to verify circuit functionality through waveform analysis.<br>
Power consumption was measured at different processing corners, operating at 1 GHz frequency, 1 V supply voltage, and 10% switching activity, targeting a 45 nm technology node.<br>
This project involved considerable debugging.<br></p>
